# gradle
Gradle is the next evolutionary step in JVM-based build tools . Gradle is an open-source build automation system.It introduce 
Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL).Gradle was designed for multi-project builds, which can grow to be quite large. 
It supports incremental builds by intelligently determining which parts of the build tree are up to date; any task dependent 
on those parts does  not need to be re-executed. Gradle uses maven and Ant repositories  . A repositories  is place where we 
can define dependencies of our project.Dependency management is employed to automatically download artifacts from a repository 
and make them available to your application.Gradle's ability to manage dependencies isn't limited to external libraries. As your
project grows in size and complexity, you'll want to organize the code into modules with clearly defined responsibilities. Gradle
provides powerful support for defining and organizing multiproject builds, as well as modeling dependencies between projects.
